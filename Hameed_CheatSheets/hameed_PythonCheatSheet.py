    Characteristics and Actions in English Grammar
Another way to think about characteristics and actions is in terms of English grammar. 
{A characteristic would be a noun}. On the other hand, {an action would be a verb}.

Let's pick something from the real-world: {a dog.}
A few characteristics could be the dog's weight, color, breed, and height. These are all nouns. 
What actions would a dog take? A dog can bark, run, bite and eat. These are all verbs.

"""
=== Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Vocabulary ====
    - class - a blueprint consisting of methods and attributes
    - object - an instance of a class. It can help to think of objects as something 
        in the real world like a yellow pencil, a small dog, a blue shirt, etc. 
        However, as you'll see later in the lesson, objects can be more abstract.
    - attribute - a descriptor or characteristic. Examples would be color, length, 
        size, etc. These attributes can take on specific values like blue, 3 inches, 
        large, etc.
    - method - an action that a class or object could take
    - OOP - a commonly used abbreviation for object-oriented programming
    - encapsulation - one of the fundamental ideas behind object-oriented programming is 
        called encapsulation: you can combine functions and data all into a single entity. 
        In object-oriented programming, this single entity is called a class. 
        Encapsulation allows you to hide implementation details much like 
        how the scikit-learn package hides the implementation of machine learning algorithms.

Self tells Python where to look in the computer's memory for the shirt_one object. 
And then Python changes the price of the shirt_one object. When you 
call the change_price method, shirt_one.change_price(12), self is implicitly passed in.

The word self is just a convention. You could actually use any other name as 
long as you are consistent; however, you should always use self rather than some

''' == {16} Anaconda == '''
# conda: manage dependencies and isolate projects with support other languages than Python.
# -------------------------------------------------------------
"""
- Anaconda is an open source distribution for Python designed for large-scale data. 
    With Anaconda you will be able to simplify package management.
- It comes with conda, a package and environment manager. You'll be using conda 
    to create environments for isolating your projects that use different versions 
    of Python and/or different packages.

- You can install multiple packages at the same time. Something like 
conda install numpy scipy pandas
conda create -n my_env python=3.6 numpy pandas

- Conda also automatically {installs dependencies }for you. For example.
    {scipy depends on numpy}, it uses and requires numpy. If you install just scipy 
    {conda install scipy}, Conda will also install numpy if it isn't already installed.

- If you don't know the exact name of the package you're looking for, you can 
    try searching with 

conda search *search_term*         # conda search '*beautifulsoup*' هيرجعلك اسم الباكدج الصح
    e.g., I know I want to install Beautiful Soup, but I'm not sure of the exact package name.

### Managing environments
--------------------------
For example, {to create an environment named my_env and install numpy in it}, type 
conda create -n my_env numpy    # create my_env environment and install numpy in it
conda activate          # activate conda environment
conda deactivate        # deactivate conda environment


### Why we're using Python 3
-----------------------------
    - Jupyter is switching to Python 3 only
    - Python 2.7 is being retired
    - Python 3 has been out for almost 10 years, and there are very few dependencies.


### The main breakage between Python 2 and 3?
----------------------------------------------
    The place where your Python 2 code will fail most often is {the print statement}.

# Python 2
    print "Hello", "world!"

# In Python 2.6+
    from __future__ import print_function
    print("Hello", "world!")
    > Hello world!

# This was changed in Python 3 to a function.
    print("Hello", "world!")
    > Hello world!


### Why using conda?
--------------------

    -First, since Anaconda comes with a bunch of data science packages, you'll be 
        all set to start working with data. Secondly, using conda to manage your 
        packages and environments will reduce future issues dealing with the various 
        libraries you'll be using.

    - Package managers are used to install libraries and other software on your computer. 
        You’re probably already familiar with pip, it’s the default package manager 
        for Python libraries. Conda is similar to pip except that the available 
        packages are focused around data science while pip is for general use.
    
    - {conda} is not Python specific like {pip} is, it can also install non-Python packages.
        It is a package manager for any software stack.

''' == {17} Jupyter notebooks == '''
# -------------------------------------------------------------
"""
The notebook is a web application that allows you to combine explanatory text, math equations, 
code, and visualizations all in one easily sharable document. 

Notebooks have quickly become an essential tool when working with data. You'll find them being 
    used for data cleaning and exploration, visualization, machine learning, 
    and big data analysis.


=== Headers ===
----------------
# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3


=== Links ===
----------------
Linking in Markdown is done by enclosing text in square brackets and the URL in parentheses, 
like this for a link to Udacity's home page.

[Udacity's home page](https://www.udacity.com) 
[I'm an inline-style link with title](https://www.google.com "Google's Homepage")


=== Emphasis ===
----------------

- You can add emphasis through bold or italics with asterisks or underscores (* or _).
    For italics, wrap the text in one asterisk or underscore, {_gelato_ or *gelato*} 
    renders as gelato(italic).

- Bold text uses {two} symbols, {**aardvark** or __aardvark__} 
    looks like aardvark(bold).

- Either asterisks or underscores are fine as long as you use the same symbol on both sides of the text.




=== Code ===
----------------
There are two different ways to display code, inline with text and as a code block separated 
from the text. To format inline code, 
(1) wrap the text in backticks. 
    For example, `string.punctuation`   الزرار اللى تحت الescape
                    renders as string.punctuation.

    To create a code block, start a new line and wrap the text in three backticks

```python
import requests
response = requests.get('https://www.udacity.com')
```



(2) or {indent each line of the code block with four spaces}.

    import requests
    response = requests.get('https://www.udacity.com')







=== Math expressions ===
----------------

You can create math expressions in Markdown cells using LaTeX symbols. 
Notebooks use MathJax to render the LaTeX symbols as math symbols. 
To start math mode, wrap the LaTeX in dollar signs $y = mx + b$ for inline math. 
For a math block, use double dollar signs,

$$
y = \frac{a}{b+c}
$$
    renders as (y=a/b+c)









=== Lists ===
----------------

(In this example, leading and trailing spaces are shown with with dots: ⋅)

1. First ordered list item
2. Another item

⋅⋅* Unordered sub-list. 
1. Actual numbers don't matter, just that it's a number
⋅⋅1. Ordered sub-list
4. And another item.

⋅⋅⋅You can have properly indented paragraphs within list items. Notice the blank line above, and the leading spaces (at least one, but we'll use three here to also align the raw Markdown).

⋅⋅⋅To have a line break without a paragraph, you will need to use two trailing spaces.⋅⋅
⋅⋅⋅Note that this line is separate, but within the same paragraph.⋅⋅
⋅⋅⋅(This is contrary to the typical GFM line break behaviour, where trailing spaces are not required.)

* Unordered list can use asterisks
- Or minuses
+ Or pluses







=== Images ===
---------------
Here's our logo (hover to see the title text):

Inline-style: 
![alt text](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/raw/master/src/common/images/icon48.png "Logo Title Text 1")






===Line Breaks===
------------------
My basic recommendation for learning how line breaks work is to experiment and discover -- 
{hit <Enter> once (i.e., insert one newline)}, then hit it twice (i.e., insert two newlines), 
see what happens. You'll soon learn to get what you want. "Markdown Toggle" is your friend.

Here are some things to try out:

Here's a line for us to start with.

This line is separated from the one above by two newlines, so it will be a *separate paragraph*.

This line is also a separate paragraph, but...
This line is only separated by a single newline, so it's a separate line in the *same paragraph*.





=== Horizontal Rule ===
-----------------------
Three or more...

---

Hyphens

***

Asterisks

___

Underscores








=== Code and Syntax Highlighting ===
-------------------------------------
```javascript
var s = "JavaScript syntax highlighting";
alert(s);
```
 
```python
s = "Python syntax highlighting"
print s
```






=== Tables ===
---------------

Colons can be used to align columns.

| Tables        | Are           | Cool  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| col 3 is      | right-aligned | $1600 |
| col 2 is      | centered      |   $12 |
| zebra stripes | are neat      |    $1 |

There must be at least 3 dashes separating each header cell.
The outer pipes (|) are optional, and you don't need to make the 
raw Markdown line up prettily. You can also use inline Markdown.

Markdown | Less | Pretty
--- | --- | ---
*Still* | `renders` | **nicely**
1 | 2 | 3






=== YouTube Videos ===
-------------

They can't be added directly but you can add an image with a link to the video like this:

<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=YOUTUBE_VIDEO_ID_HERE
" target="_blank"><img src="http://img.youtube.com/vi/YOUTUBE_VIDEO_ID_HERE/0.jpg" 
alt="IMAGE ALT TEXT HERE" width="240" height="180" border="10" /></a>








=== Magic keywords ===
------------------------
Magic keywords are special commands you can run in cells that let you 
control the notebook itself or perform system calls such as changing directories. 
For example, you can set up matplotlib to work interactively in the notebook with %matplotlib.

Magic commands are preceded with one or two percent signs (% or %%)


== Timing code==
At some point, you'll probably spend some effort optimizing code to run faster. 
Timing how quickly your code runs is essential for this optimization. 
You can use the timeit magic command to time how long it takes for a function to run.


%timeit function call()
%%timeit            put it at the first line of code to print the code execution time

Using a main block
To avoid running executable statements in a script when it's imported as a module in another script, 
include these lines in an if __name__ == "__main__" block. Or alternatively, 
include them in a function called main() and call this in the if main block.

Whenever we run a script like this, Python actually sets a special built-in variable called __name__ 
for any module. When we run a script, Python recognizes this module as the main program, 
and sets the __name__ variable for this module to the string "__main__". 
For any modules that are imported in this script, 
this built-in __name__ variable is just set to the name of that module.
Therefore, the condition if __name__ == "__main__"is just checking whether this module is the main program.

''' = {16.1} NumPy = '''
"""
- NumPy stands for Numerical Python and it's a fundamental package for scientific 
    computing in Python. NumPy provides Python with an extensive math library 
    capable of performing numerical computations effectively and efficiently.

- Why should we use NumPy?
1- NumPy uses much less memory to store data
    The NumPy arrays takes significantly less amount of memory as compared to python lists. 
    It also provides a mechanism of specifying the data types of the contents, 
    which allows further optimization of the code.

2- One such feature is speed. When performing operations on large arrays NumPy can 
    often perform several orders of magnitude faster than Python lists. 




- At the core of NumPy is the ndarray, where nd stands for n-dimensional. 
    An ndarray is a multidimensional array of elements all of the same type. 
    In other words, an ndarray is a grid that can take on many shapes and can 
    hold either numbers or strings. In many Machine Learning problems you will 
    often find yourself using ndarrays in many different ways. 
    For instance, you might use an ndarray to hold the pixel values of an image 
    will be fed into a Neural Network for image classification.

"""
import numpy as np

"""
There are several ways to create ndarrays in NumPy. 
In the following lessons we will see two ways to create ndarrays:

    1- Using regular Python lists       np.array() 
    2-Using built-in NumPy functions
"""
# We import NumPy into Python
import numpy as np

# We create a 1D ndarray that contains only integers
x = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])       

# Let's print the ndarray we just created using the print() command
print('x = ', x)            # x = [1 2 3 4 5]



"""
Let's pause for a second to introduce some useful terminology. We refer to 1D arrays as rank 1 arrays. 
    In general N-Dimensional arrays have rank N. Therefore, we refer to a 2D array as a rank 2 array. 
    Another important property of arrays is their shape. The shape of an array is the size along each of its dimensions. 
    For example, the shape of a rank 2 array will correspond to the number of rows and columns of the array. 
    As you will see, NumPy ndarrays have attributes that allow us to get information about them 
    in a very intuitive way. 
    For example, the shape of an ndarray can be obtained using the .shape attribute. 
    The shape attribute returns a tuple of N positive integers that specify the sizes of each dimension. 
    In the example below we will create a rank 1 array and learn how to obtain its shape, 
    its type, and the data-type (dtype) of its elements.

## NumPy DataCamp
"""
The NumPy library is the core library for scientific computing in
Python. It provides a high-performance multidimensional array
object, and tools for working with these arrays.
"""

## Creating Arrays
a = np.array([1,2,3])
b = np.array([(1.5,2,3), (4,5,6)], dtype = float)
c = np.array([[(1.5,2,3), (4,5,6)], [(3,2,1), (4,5,6)]],dtype = float)





## Initial Placeholders
np.zeros((3,4))                      # Create an array of zeros
np.ones((2,3,4),dtype=np.int16)      # Create an array of ones
d = np.arrange(10,25,5)               # Create an array of evenly spaced values (step value)
np.linspace(0,2,9)                  #Create an array of evenly spaced values (number of samples)
e = np.full((2,2),7)                # Create a constant array
f = np.eye(2)                       # Create a 2X2 identity matrix
np.random.random((2,2))             # Create an array with random values
np.empty((3,2))                     # Create an empty array



## I/O ##

# Saving & Loading On Disk
np.save('my_array', a)
np.savez('array.npz', a, b)
np.load('my_array.npy')

# Saving & Loading Text Files
np.loadtxt("myfile.txt")
np.genfromtxt("my_file.csv", delimiter=',')
np.savetxt("myarray.txt", a, delimiter=" ")


## Data Types ##
np.int64        # Signed 64-bit integer types
np.float32      # Standard double-precision floating point
np.complex      # Complex numbers represented by 128 floats
np.bool         # Boolean type storing TRUE and FALSE values
np.object       # Python object type
np.string_      # Fixed-length string type
np.unicode_     # Fixed-length unicode type



## Inspecting Your Array ##
a.shape         # Array dimensions
len(a)          # Length of array
b.ndim          # Number of array dimensions
e.size          # Number of array elements
b.dtype         # Data type of array elements
b.dtype.name    # Name of data type
b.astype(int)   # Convert an array to a different type

np.info(np.ndarray.dtype)



## Array Mathematics ##

# Arithmetic Operations
np.subtract(a,b)        # Substraction
np.add(b,a)             # Addition
np.divide(a,b)          # Division
np.multiply(a,b)        # Multiplication
np.exp(b)               # Exponentiation
np.sqrt(b)              # Square root
np.sin(a)               # Print sines of an array
np.cos(b)               # Element-wise cosine
np.log(a)               # Element-wise natural logarithm
e.dot(f)                # Dot product


# Comparison
a == b                  # Element-wise comparison
a < 2                   # Element-wise comparison   array([True, False, False], dtype=bool)
np.array_equal(a, b)    # Array-wise comparison

# Aggregate Functions
a.sum()                 # Array-wise sum
a.min()                 # Array-wise minimum value
b.max(axis=0)           # Maximum value of an array row
b.cumsum(axis=1)        # Cumulative sum of the elements
a.mean()                # Mean
b.median()              # Median
a.corrcoef()            # Correlation coefficient
np.std(b)               # Standard deviation


## Copying Arrays ##
h = a.view()            # Create a view of the array with the same data
np.copy(a)              # Create a copy of the array
h = a.copy()            # Create a deep copy of the array

## Sorting Arrays ##
a.sort()            # Sort an array
c.sort(axis=0)      # Sort the elements of an array's axis




## Subsetting, Slicing, Indexing ##
# Subsetting
a[2]                    # Select the element at the 2nd index in 1D array
b[1,2]                  # Select the element at row 1 column 2
b[1][2]


# Slicing
a[0:2]                  # Select items at index 0 and 1
b[0:2,1]                # Select items at rows 0 and 1 in column 1
b[:1]                   # Select all items at row 0
b[0:1, :]
c[1,...]
a[ : :-1]               # Reversed array a 


# Boolean Indexing
a[a<2]                  # Select elements from a less than 2

#  Fancy Indexing
b[[1, 0, 1, 0],[0, 1, 2, 0]]        # Select elements (1,0),(0,1),(1,2) and (0,0)
b[[1, 0, 1, 0]][:,[0,1,2,0]]        # Select a subset of the matrix’s rows and matrix




## Array Manipulation ##
#  Transposing Array
i = np.transpose(b)                 # Permute array dimensions
i.T                                 # Permute array dimensions
# Changing Array Shape
b.ravel()                           # Flatten the array
g.reshape(3,-2)                     # Reshape, but don’t change data
# Adding/Removing Elements
h.resize((2,6))                     # Return a new array with shape (2,6)
np.append(h,g)                      # Append items to an array
np.insert(a, 1, 5)                  # Insert items in an array
np.delete(a,[1])                    # Delete items from an array
# Combining Arrays
np.concatenate((a,d),axis=0)        # Concatenate arrays
np.vstack((a,b))                    # Stack arrays vertically (row-wise)
np.r_[e,f]                          # Stack arrays vertically (row-wise)
np.hstack((e,f))                    # Stack arrays horizontally (column-wise)
np.column_stack((a,d))              # Create stacked column-wise arrays
np.c_[a,d]                          # Create stacked column-wise arrays

# Splitting Arrays
np.hsplit(a,3)                      # Split the array horizontally at the 3rd index
np.vsplit(c,2)                      # Split the array vertically at the 2nd index

How to Search - Here are some techniques for effective web searching:

1- Try using "Python" or the name of the library you're using as the first word of your query. 
2- This tells the search engine to prioritize results that are explicitly related to the tools you're using.
3- Writing a good search query can take multiple attempts. 
4- If you don't find helpful results on your first attempt, try again.
5- Try using keywords found on the pages you found in your initial search to direct the 
    search engine to better resources in the subsequent search.
6- Copy and paste error messages to use as search terms. This will lead you to explanations 
    of the error and potential causes. An error message might include references 
    to specific line numbers of code that you wrote. Only include the part of the error 
    message that comes before this in your search.
7- If you can't find an answer to your question, ask it yourself! Communities like 
    StackOverflow have etiquette rules you must learn if you want to participate, 
    but don't let this stop you from using these resources.

e.g. UnboundLocalError: local variable 'egg_count' referenced before assignment
        my search query should be: python UnboundLocalError: local variable

{Hierarchy of Online Resources}
While there are many online resources about programming, not all of the them are created equal. 
This list of resources is in approximate order of reliability.

    1- https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/ - The Python Tutorial - This section of the 
        official documentation surveys Python's syntax and standard library. 
        It uses examples, and is written using less technical language than the main 
        documentation. Make sure you're reading the Python 3 version of the docs!

    2- https://docs.python.org/3/index.html - The Python Language and Library References - 
        The Language Reference and Library Reference are more technical than the tutorial, 
        but they are the definitive sources of truth. As you become increasingly 
        acquainted with Python you should use these resources more and more.
    3- http://stackoverflow.com/ - StackOverflow - This question and answer site has 
        a good amount of traffic, so it's likely that someone has asked 
        (and someone has answered) a related question before! However, 
        answers are provided by volunteers and vary in quality. Always understand 
        solutions before putting them into your program. One line answers without any 
        explanation are dubious. This is a good place to find out more about your 
        question or discover alternative search terms.
